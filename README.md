## 🔍 Overview

The project pipeline is divided into three core phases:

1. **📥 Data Collection & Indexing Infrastructure**:
   - Collect and preprocess data for efficient retrieval.
   - Build robust indexing and retrieval systems with spell correction and vector space models.

2. **🧠 Machine Learning & Clustering**:
   - Leverage classification algorithms and clustering techniques to improve document categorization and organization.

3. **🌐 Web Crawling & Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Enhance the system by incorporating web crawling, link analysis, and personalized recommendation engines.

## 🛠️ Workflow Phases

### 📂 Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Indexing Infrastructure

In this phase, we establish a strong foundation for data processing and retrieval. 

**Datasets**:
- Source: [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)
- Focus: Artificial Intelligence & Bioinformatics

**Key Components**:
- 🛠️ **Data Preprocessing**: Structuring academic papers for indexing.
- 📍 **Positional Index Construction**: Creating a positional index for precise search results.
- ✏️ **Spell Correction**: Bigram-based system to correct typos in queries.
- 📐 **Vector Space Modeling**:
  - `ltn-lnn`: Term frequency normalization.
  - `ltc-lnc`: Adjustments for term and document frequency.
  - `Okapi BM25`: Probabilistic ranking model.
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics such as MRR, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, MAP, and nDCG ensure robust performance analysis.

### 🧬 Phase 2: Machine Learning and Clustering for Document Retrieval

This phase enhances search capabilities with classification and clustering techniques.

**Datasets**:
- Source: [Kaggle ArXiv Abstracts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spsayakpaul/arxiv-paper-abstracts?resource=download)

**Key Components**:
- 🗂️ **Naive Bayes Classification**: Basic categorization of documents.
- 🤖 **Neural Network Classifier**: Improved accuracy for document classification.
- 🔍 **Large Language Models**: Fine-tuned models for advanced categorization.
- 🗂️ **Hierarchical Clustering**: Organizing documents into meaningful groups.

### 🕸️ Phase 3: Web Crawling, Link Analysis, and Personalized Search

The final phase focuses on enriching data and delivering personalized recommendations. 

**Key Components**:
- 🕷️ **Web Crawling**: Gathering additional data from academic sources.
- 🔗 **Link Analysis**:
  - **PageRank**: Measure document importance.
  - **HITS**: Identify hubs and authorities in document networks.
- 🧠 **Recommendation Engines**:
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend articles based on similarity.
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggest articles based on user preferences.
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics like nDCG assess recommendation quality.


### 🌟 Final Deliverable

A powerful and user-friendly recommender system capable of retrieving, organizing, ranking, and recommending academic articles.
